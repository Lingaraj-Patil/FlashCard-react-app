# Flashcard App

This is a simple Flashcard application built with React and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to create, view, flip, and delete flashcards. The flashcards are stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Flashcards**: Create a new flashcard with a question and answer.
- **Flip Flashcards**: Toggle between showing the question and answer.
- **Delete Flashcards**: Remove a flashcard from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Flashcards are stored in `localStorage` to persist across sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing component state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For easy and responsive styling.
- **localStorage**: For saving flashcards persistently in the browser.
